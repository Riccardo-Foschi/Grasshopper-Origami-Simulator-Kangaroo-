This Grasshopper Algorithm is aimed at simulating the folding and unfolding of Origami Crease Patterns. 
The Crease patterns are drawn in Rhino as Curves and uploaded in Grasshopper.
It supports the following types of curves:
-mountain
-valley
-unassigned
-boundaries

Also, it supports several constraints:
-Anchor points
-Glue points
-Points sliding on curve rails
-Points sliding on surfaces
-Planarization of curves

It implements several analysis tools:
-estimation of approximated ruling (for curve folded designs)
-estimation of area and length error
-colorization of the mesh based on error
